# Hi, I'm Lluis 👋👨‍💻

I'm a Software Engineering Manager who is passionate about helping people, create tech products and learn new stuff every day. I'm currently working at Citibox as Engineering Manager contributing to the reduction of the CO2 emissions, as well as providing help to small and medium startups as part-time interim Engineering Manager. Some of the technologies I enjoy the most are ReactJS and GraphQL.
